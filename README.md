## 🛠️ Development Progress

### 🚧 Currently In Focus

We are actively working on:

- **Main Page UI/UX:** Refining the visual design and user experience of the primary interface.
- **Data Integration:** Developing and refining JSON files for essential game data (species, weapons, classes, armors, tools, etc.).
- **Character Persistence:** Enhancing character creation flow and ensuring robust saving/loading to a local JSON file (targeting `C:\Users\[user]\Documents\DnDAppCharacters`).
- **Displaying Character Information:** Implementing UI elements to show the created character's details.

### ✨ Recently Added

The newest features integrated into the project:

- Character name input.
- Species and sub-species selection (where applicable).
- Ability score assignment (basic input and random generation).
- Class selection.
- Basic character data saving to JSON.
- Home page with character loading/creation/deletion options.

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

Once the core application is stable, we plan to expand with:

- **Expanded Species:** Incorporating races beyond the Player's Handbook.
- **Expanded Classes & Subclasses:** Adding character classes and subclasses beyond the Player's Handbook.
- **Full Character Sheet View:** A comprehensive display of all character attributes, skills, inventory, etc.
- **Integrated Dice Roller:** For various game checks and rolls.
- **Inventory Management.**
- **Spell Book Management.**

## 💡 Important Note

While Draconae aims to be a comprehensive character management tool, it **does not replace official D&D 5e source material.**

> We highly recommend you have access to the Player's Handbook and other relevant rulebooks (e.g., via D&D Beyond, physical copies) for detailed rules, lore, and descriptions. This app focuses on character mechanics and tracking.

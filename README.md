    - **Ability & Saving Throw Rolls:** Roll saving throws with correctly calculated modifiers and proficiency bonuses.
    - **Attack Rolls:** Perform attack rolls using the appropriate ability modifier and proficiency.
    - **XP and Leveling:** Add XP, track your progress to the next level with a progress bar, and automatically level up when the threshold is met.
